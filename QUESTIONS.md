## 1. Does race change stats? (#2)

Human, Elf and Dwarf are choosable but have **no stat effect yet**. There is a placeholder table, `StatDistributions.GetRaceModifier`, that returns all zeros. If races should change stats, what are the numbers for each?

## 2. Is there a cap on stats? (#2)

8 is the starting value. Is there a maximum (for example 20), and can a stat go below some minimum? Nothing is capped in code right now.

## 3. Character name rules (#2)

Assumed for now: 1 to 20 characters, letters, digits, spaces, `'` and `-`. Is that fine?
