# Open questions

Questions for Dyllan. Answer them in the matching GitHub issue or tell the team in the room, and we'll update the code and tick them off here.

## 1. Does race change stats? (#2)

Human, Elf and Dwarf are choosable but have **no stat effect yet**. There is a placeholder table, `StatDistributions.GetRaceModifier`, that returns all zeros. If races should change stats, what are the numbers for each?

## 2. Is there a cap on stats? (#2)

8 is the starting value. Is there a maximum (for example 20), and can a stat go below some minimum? Nothing is capped in code right now.

## 3. Character name rules (#2)

Assumed for now: 1 to 20 characters, letters, digits, spaces, `'` and `-`. Is that fine?

## 4. Real combat for "Slice and slime" (#8)

Placeholder in place until a combat system exists: with a **weapon in Main Hand** and a slime on one of the 8 tiles around you, **Space** defeats it (it is removed from the map) and counts toward the quest. Without a weapon the game says "You need a weapon". Is that acceptable for now? What should real combat look like (health, damage, cooldown, respawning slimes)?

## 5. Colonel Powers' other lines (#8)

Only the "I see you lack the skill..." line was given. We made up these, please correct them:
- while the quest is active: "Keep at it, {name}... Slimes slain {n}/5."
- after the quest is complete: "Well done, {name}. You have learned to survive... for now."

Also assumed: the Practice Sword is given (and auto-equipped to Main Hand) when you **accept**, only once; saying No keeps nothing, and talking to him again re-offers the quest without repeating the intro. Is the Practice Sword meant to be kept after the quest?

## 6. Inventory stacking and what "Slash" does (#8, #9)

Items that can be worn never stack. Items with a stack size above 1 would stack up to that size (none exist yet). The Slash ability is only recorded on the character for now: what does it do, and how is it triggered?
